# Design notes

Dated build log for Bench Coach. One entry per iteration, with the reason for each change.

## 2026-10-23: Section 9 verifications (plan `docs/BENCH_COACH_PLAN.md`)

Environment: Lens Studio 5.23.2, SIK 2.0.0, UIKit 2.0.0, LEAF 2.0.2, preview on SPECS 27 Interactive (Plane scene).

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Black in preview | **Black vanishes.** With the SPECS simulation on, a pure black cube at 90 cm did not render at all; a mid-grey (0.5) cube rendered. Wheel stays mid-grey. | Preview screenshot, two 20 cm unlit cubes at z = -90 |
| 2 | Procedural wheel in one pass | **Pass.** `Stand` (base, post, clamp) and `Wheel` (`Hub`, `Rim`, `Spokes/Spoke_0..15`, `Tire/Bead_0..7`, `Tube/TubeSeg_0..7`, `TubeEnd`, `Valve`) built in one VirtualScene apply. Every part is its own SceneObject; Stand, Rim, Spoke, Tire, Tube and Valve have separate materials. | Front screenshot and isometric runtime capture; no runtime errors |
| 3 | LEAF install + trivial button scenario | **Pass.** LEAF 2.0.2 installed from the Asset Library (pulls Bitmoji 3D). `verify-button` triggers a UIKit `Button` named `BtnVerify` and asserts the press counter went up by one. | LEAF panel: `PASSED: verify-button` (1.5 s) |
| 4 | Grab in preview | **Pass.** `LeverA` with `Interactable` + `InteractableManipulation` (box collider 12 x 2 x 1). Mouse drag (injected touch start/move/end) grabbed, moved 8.9 cm and released. Hand-sim drag via the preview interaction tool moved it 10.8 cm. LEAF `verify-lever-drag` moved it and saw one manipulation start and one end. | Log lines `[GrabbableLever] LeverA grabbed / released`; LEAF panel `PASSED: verify-lever-drag` |

Findings that change the plan:

- **`PinchButton` does not exist in SIK 2.0.** Buttons are UIKit `Button` / `RectangleButton` / `CapsuleButton`. They extend `Interactable`, so LEAF `trigger` and the preview mouse both work. Subscribe with `button.onTriggerUp`.
- **Mesh presets have fixed proportions.** The torus preset is a fat 1:3 donut, so a 62 cm rim with a 1.6 cm tube cannot come from presets. Rim, bead segments and tube segments are built at runtime by `Assets/BenchCoach/Scripts/TorusArc.ts` (MeshBuilder, one arc per object, end caps on partial arcs). Spokes, hub, stand and valve use cylinder and box presets.
- **LEAF `drag(target, vector, ms)` applies the vector every frame**, not once. A (10, 6, 0) vector over 800 ms moved the lever about 438 cm. Tests must use small per-frame vectors (for example 0.3 cm per frame) and assert on the final position.
- **Mouse grab needs a hover frame first.** A press that starts on the lever without the cursor having hovered it first does nothing; moving the cursor onto the lever, then pressing, grabs. Real mouse use does this naturally.
- **Floor height is not documented for the preview.** The stand assumes the eye is 150 cm above the floor: stand base at y = -150, hub at y = -25 (100 cm off the floor). Adjust if the preview floor turns out to be elsewhere.
- **Preview framing.** A 70 cm wheel at 90 cm fills the SPECS view; the plan already designs around the part the user is looking at.

Scaffolding left in the scene after this step, to be replaced by the first build: `VerifyButton` (script `VerifyButtonUI.ts`), `LeverA` (script `GrabbableLever.ts`), `LeafIndex` with the two verification scenarios under `Assets/BenchCoach/Tests/`.
