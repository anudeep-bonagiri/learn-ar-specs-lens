# Design notes

Dated build log for Bench Coach. One entry per iteration, with the reason for each change.

## 2026-10-23: Section 9 verifications (plan `docs/BENCH_COACH_PLAN.md`)

Environment: Lens Studio 5.23.2, SIK 2.0.0, UIKit 2.0.0, LEAF 2.0.2, preview on SPECS 27 Interactive (Plane scene).

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Black in preview | **Black vanishes.** With the SPECS simulation on, a pure black cube at 90 cm did not render at all; a mid-grey (0.5) cube rendered. Wheel stays mid-grey. | Preview screenshot, two 20 cm unlit cubes at z = -90 |
| 2 | Procedural wheel in one pass | **Pass.** `Stand` (base, post, clamp) and `Wheel` (`Hub`, `Rim`, `Spokes/Spoke_0..15`, `Tire/Bead_0..7`, `Tube/TubeSeg_0..7`, `TubeEnd`, `Valve`) built in one VirtualScene apply. Every part is its own SceneObject; Stand, Rim, Spoke, Tire, Tube and Valve have separate materials. | Front screenshot and isometric runtime capture; no runtime errors |
| 3 | LEAF install + trivial button scenario | **Pass.** LEAF 2.0.2 installed from the Asset Library (pulls Bitmoji 3D). `verify-button` triggers a UIKit `Button` named `BtnVerify` and asserts the press counter went up by one. | LEAF panel: `PASSED: verify-button` (1.5 s) |
| 4 | Grab in preview | **Pass.** `LeverA` with `Interactable` + `InteractableManipulation` (box collider 12 x 2 x 1). Mouse drag (injected touch start/move/end) grabbed, moved 8.9 cm and released. Hand-sim drag via the preview interaction tool moved it 10.8 cm. LEAF `verify-lever-drag` moved it and saw one manipulation start and one end. | Log lines `[GrabbableLever] LeverA grabbed / released`; LEAF panel `PASSED: verify-lever-drag` |

Findings that change the plan:

- **`PinchButton` does not exist in SIK 2.0.** Buttons are UIKit `Button` / `RectangleButton` / `CapsuleButton`. They extend `Interactable`, so LEAF `trigger` and the preview mouse both work. Subscribe with `button.onTriggerUp`.
- **Mesh presets have fixed proportions.** The torus preset is a fat 1:3 donut, so a 62 cm rim with a 1.6 cm tube cannot come from presets. Rim, bead segments and tube segments are built at runtime by `Assets/BenchCoach/Scripts/TorusArc.ts` (MeshBuilder, one arc per object, end caps on partial arcs). Spokes, hub, stand and valve use cylinder and box presets.
- **LEAF `drag(target, vector, ms)` applies the vector every frame**, not once. A (10, 6, 0) vector over 800 ms moved the lever about 438 cm. Tests must use small per-frame vectors (for example 0.3 cm per frame) and assert on the final position.
- **Mouse grab needs a hover frame first.** A press that starts on the lever without the cursor having hovered it first does nothing; moving the cursor onto the lever, then pressing, grabs. Real mouse use does this naturally.
- **Floor height is not documented for the preview.** The stand assumes the eye is 150 cm above the floor: stand base at y = -150, hub at y = -25 (100 cm off the floor). Adjust if the preview floor turns out to be elsewhere.
- **Preview framing.** A 70 cm wheel at 90 cm fills the SPECS view; the plan already designs around the part the user is looking at.

Scaffolding left in the scene after this step, to be replaced by the first build: `VerifyButton` (script `VerifyButtonUI.ts`), `LeverA` (script `GrabbableLever.ts`), `LeafIndex` with the two verification scenarios under `Assets/BenchCoach/Tests/`.

## 2026-10-23: First build, criteria 1 to 3 (plan Section 7)

Built by the CLAD Specs Experience Builder through the Lens Studio MCP. Scene: `BenchCoach` root (`RepairManager` + `UIBindings`) with `StartCard`, `ControlBar`, `StepMarker`, `StepLabel`, `ToolTray` (`ToolTrayPanel`, `LeverA`, `LeverB`), `DoneCard`; `LeverSocket` and `GhostLever` under `Wheel`; `WheelTargets` on `Wheel` adds pinch targets to `Valve` and `Bead_0/2/4/6`. Scripts under `Assets/BenchCoach/Scripts/`, scenarios under `Assets/BenchCoach/Tests/` (`start`, `deflate-loosen`, `lever-snap`).

| Criterion | LEAF scenario | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Found it places the wheel; marker on the valve | `start` | PASSED (marker 1.5 cm from the valve) |
| 2 Valve + four beads complete steps 1 and 2; one marker at a time | `deflate-loosen` | PASSED |
| 3 Lever A rejects at 10 cm, snaps within 4 cm, lifts Bead_0 | `lever-snap` | PASSED (reject at 9.9 cm returned to tray; snap at 1.5 cm; Bead_0 lift 1.0 cm) |

Findings that change the plan:

- **Class getters are invisible across component-typed `@input`s.** `get onFoundIt()` on a UI module read as `undefined` from `UIBindings`; public fields (`onFoundIt: PublicApi<void> = this._onFoundIt.publicApi()`, the SIK style) work. Same for `getState()`-style methods: use methods or fields, never getters, on anything another script reads through an `@input`.
- **UIKit 2.0 `FlexLayout.addItems()` throws before init unless `autoDiscoverItemsOnStart = false`.** The shared `UIHelpers.makeFlex` sets it to false so layouts can be composed in `onAwake`.
- **LEAF drag is steered per frame.** `BenchCoachLeafInteractor.dragTo(target, worldPos)` adjusts the interactor each `onDragUpdate` toward a world position and releases when within 0.4 cm (or on timeout), so snap and reject tests are frame-rate independent.
- **The LEAF ChatTools (`list_leaf_scenarios`, `run_leaf_scenario`, `open_leaf_panel`) are callable from editor code** via `IChatToolRegistry.execute()` when the MCP client does not surface them.
- **Deflate scales `Tube` with `Tire`**; shrinking the tire alone sank the beads into the tube ring.
- Body-locked panels (`ControlBar`, `ToolTray`) are static world placements relative to the start pose in this pass; a follower would move the levers' parent mid-drag.
